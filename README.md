# Machine Learning 

This repository contains all the Machine Learning projects.
These were the Algorithms developed

## Naive Bayes Classifier
The Classifer was trained on the IMDB Movie review dataset to classify the reviews as positive or negative. This classifier was trained with a prior of beta_0 = 5 and beta_1 = 7 to obtain a error rate of 11%.

## Logistic Regression
The Classifer as well was trained on the IMDB Movie review dataset to classify the reviews as positive or negative. The classifier was trained with error rate of 11%

## Deep Neural Networks

This project is the classic implementation of the LeNet. The training and test accuracy after 10,000 iterations was 99%.
